# Tailwigor

A POC Tailwind based project

### Current Main Objectives

<ul>
  <li>Global file as base to import in projects</li>
  <li>HTML watcher that checks witch classes are being used and deliver only necessary data</li>
  <li>A hot-reload in HTML usin chokidar and sockets between HTML and Nodejs</li>
</ul>

### Description

  <p>
    Tailwind CSS has become a popular utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. In this
    coding challenge, you are tasked with creating a simplified clone of Tailwind CSS using TypeScript. We'll call this
    clone "Tailspin." Your goal is to implement a basic set of utility classes and a responsive design system similar to
    Tailwind CSS, using TypeScript to ensure type safety and a better developer experience.
  </p>

  <h1>Objectives:</h1>
  <p>
    Implement a set of utility classes for styling elements, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spacing (margin and padding)</li>
    <li>Typography (font size, font weight, line height, and text alignment)</li>
    <li>Colors (background, text, and border colors)</li>
    <li>Borders (border width, border radius, and border style)</li>
    <li>Flexbox and Grid layout utilities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Create a responsive design system using breakpoints similar to Tailwind CSS:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Small (640px)</li>
    <li>Medium (768px)</li>
    <li>Large (1024px)</li>
    <li>Extra Large (1280px)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Allow users to extend or customize the configuration, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding custom breakpoints</li>
    <li>Modifying default values (e.g., spacing, colors, fonts)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Ensure type safety and autocompletion support with TypeScript.
  </p>

  <h1>Requirements:</h1>
  <p>
    Use TypeScript for the implementation.
  </p>
